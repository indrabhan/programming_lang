**user define exception
1)define user define exception class.
2)raise those exception explicitly.
3)handle those exception,if you dont handle the exception progrm will terminate abnormally


class classname(Exception):
	pass
--------------------------
raise userdefine classname

-------------------------
try:
	-----------
	-----------
except(userdefine classname):
	print the message



Example:-
	try:
	  print(x)
	except NameError:			// Note you can pass exception class
	  print("Variable x is not defined")
	except:					// Note it will handle any error, you can even pass n number of exception
	  print("Something else went wrong")


In Python, users can define such exceptions by creating a new class. This exception class has to be derived, either directly or indirectly, from Exception class.

When we are developing a large Python program, it is a good practice to place all the user-defined exceptions that our program raises in a separate file. Many standard modules do this. They define their exceptions separately as exceptions.py or errors.py (generally but not always)

Example:- syntax
	try:
	   statement 1
	   statement 1
	   if condition:
		raise userdefine classname
	except userdefine classname :


Example:-
	# define Python user-defined exceptions
	class Error(Exception):
	   """Base class for other exceptions"""
	   pass
	class ValueTooSmallError(Error):
	   """Raised when the input value is too small"""
	   pass
	class ValueTooLargeError(Error):
	   """Raised when the input value is too large"""
	   pass
	# our main program
	# user guesses a number until he/she gets it right
	# you need to guess this number
	number = 10
	while True:
	   try:
	       i_num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
	       if i_num < number:
		   raise ValueTooSmallError
	       elif i_num > number:
		   raise ValueTooLargeError
	       break
	   except ValueTooSmallError:
	       print("This value is too small, try again!")
	       print()
	   except ValueTooLargeError:
	       print("This value is too large, try again!")
	       print()
	print("Congratulations! You guessed it correctly.")
