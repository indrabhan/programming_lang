*Constructor:- A constructor is a special type of method (function) which is used to initialize the instance members of the class.

		Constructors can be of two types.

			1.)Parameterized Constructor
			2.)Non-parameterized Constructor

		In python, the method __init__ simulates the constructor of the class.
		This method is called when the class is instantiated.(when class object is created.)

	Example:-
		class Employee:  
		    def __init__(self,name,id):  	# constructor, it will be called automactically when the class object is created.
			self.id = id;  
			self.name = name;  
		    def display (self):  
			print("ID: %d \n Name: %s" % (self.id,self.name))  	# %d is used for integer value
										# %s is used for string value.
		emp = Employee("John",101)  
		emp.display()

*Method Overriding:-(for overriding we must have inheritance.) (same method name in different class.)
		     When the parent class method is defined in the child class with some specific implementation, then the concept is called 			     method overriding.

	Example:-
		class Animal:  
		    def speak(self):  
			print("speaking")

		class Dog(Animal):  
		    def speak(self):  
			print("Barking")
 
		d = Dog()
		d.speak()	# o/p Barking  

*Method Overloading:-
			mulitiple method having same name but different arguments.
			python recoginized only the last method(same method name).

			Python does not support overloading because function arguments are not define with the datatype.
			In other language we define variables with datatype.
