CSV stands for Comma Separated Values

To read from csv file or write into csv file, we have a module name "csv"

Functions:-
	reader(), writer(), DictReader(), DictWriter(), writerow(), next()

	Example:- reader()
		  Here we have a csv file named as "names.csv"

		 import csv
		 with open('names.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
			csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
			next(csv_reader)			# It will skip the first row.
			for line in csv_reader:
				print line

		 OUTPUT:- The o/p will contain the remaining data in list format.
			
                 Note :- To skip the header from o/p we use "next()"



	Example:- reader() and writer()

		import csv

		with open("names.csv", 'r') as csv_file:
			csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
	
			with open('new_names.csv', 'w') as new_file:
				csv_writer = csv.writer(new_file, delimiter="-")

				for line in csv_reader:
				csv_writer.writerow(line)	# writerow() is use to write the data row by row.



	Example:- DictReader() and DictWriter()

		import csv

		with open('names.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
			csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file, delimiter="\t")
	
			with open('new_dict_names.csv', 'w') as new_file:
				fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']		     # names of header in csv file.
				csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(new_file, fieldnames = fieldnames)       # DictWrite takes 3 arguments.
				csv_writer.writeheader()					     # o/p contain the headers
	
				for line in csv_reader:
					csv_writer.writerow(line)
