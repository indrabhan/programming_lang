Python List sort()
	The sort() method sorts the elements of a given list in a specific ascending or descending order.



The syntax of the sort() method is:

	list.sort(key=..., reverse=...)
	Alternatively, you can also use Python's built-in sorted() function for the same purpose.

	sorted(list, key=..., reverse=...)

	Note: The simplest difference between sort() and sorted() is: sort() changes the list directly and doesn't return any value, while 			sorted() doesn't change the list and returns the sorted list.


	sort: return none and change the existing list.

	sorted: keeps the original list as it is and return new list.
		It is in-built method.
