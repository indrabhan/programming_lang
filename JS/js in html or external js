In live approach we write two different file i.e .js and .html, as you know js file is not executable compare to html
we call .js file in .html file


Example:- we have a.js file containg only js code and not html

	file name:- sample.js
	
	file code:- document.write("<h1> Welcome to JavaScript World</h1")


Example:- we will call .js file in out .html file

	file name:- basic_prgm.html
	
	file code:-<!doctype html>
		   <head>
		   <script src="sample.js"></script>
		   </head>
