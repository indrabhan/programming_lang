*	<pivot string="Timesheet">
	    <field name="employee_id" type="row"/>

*	In view tag:* Type is m*anadatoty
*	    aggregate:*- field and name* are manadatary
*	    formula:*-v*alue is m*anadatary. Ex:*- record.price_total / record.order_id.

	<dashboard>
	    <view type="graph" ref="sale_report.view_order_product_graph"/>
	    <group string="Sale">
		<aggregate name="price_total" field="price_total" widget="monetary"/>
		<aggregate name="order_id" field="order_id" string="Orders"/>
		<formula name="price_average" string="Price Average"
		    value="record.price_total / record.order_id" widget="percentage"/>
	    </group>
	    <view type="pivot" ref="sale_report.view_order_product_pivot"/>
	</dashboard>

Cohort:*-
*	The cohort view is used to display and understand the way some data changes over a period of time. For example, imagine that for a 		given business, clients can subscribe to some service. The cohort view can then display the total number of subscriptions each month.
	<cohort string="Subscription" date_start="date_start" date_stop="date" interval="month"/>
*	date_start:*-m*anadatory
*       date_stop:*-m*anadatory
*       string:*-m*anadatory

	By default the cohort view will use the same list and form views as those defined on the action. You can pass a list view and a form view to the context of the action in order to set/override the views that will be used (the context keys to use being form_view_id and list_view_id)
