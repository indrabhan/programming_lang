**Function return value:- 
	The method does not need to return anything, but we should have it to at least return a True value. The reason is that clients 
	can use XML-RPC to call these methods, and this protocol does not support server functions returning just a None value.


**date field:-
	For date field names, there is a convention to use date as a prefix. For example, we should
	use date_effective field instead of effective_date.

**Translate:- 
	Translate applies only to $Char , Text , and Html fields, and makes the field contents translatable, holding different values for 		different languages.
