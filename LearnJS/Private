Public:-
	Public variable declare using "this" keyword.
	Public methods are created using Prototype property of the constructor function.
	Public variable and methods can be access outside the function(constructor).
	Public methods can call Privileged methods but not private methods.

Private:-
	Private variable are declare using "var" keyword.
	nested function are the private function.
	Private variable and methods can not be access outside the function.


Privileged Function:-
	Privileged methods are created using "this" keyword.
	Privileged methods can access private variable and methods.
	Like public methods, privileged methods are also available outside the constructor function.

on the fly:-We can create and assign the value to a variable outside the function and that variable is treated as public variable.

Example:-
	<head>
	<body>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		function Employee(firstName, lastName){
			//Public Fields :- In JS we create public fields using "this" keyword.

			this.fname = firstName;
			this.lname = lastName;

			//Private Fields :- In JS we create private fields using "var" keyword.
			// this field will available inside this Employee function only and not outside

			var privateFullName;

			//Private Function
			// function privateGetFullName(){}
			// In this way also we can create private function that is nested function

			var privateGetFullName = function(){
				privateFullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
				return privateFullName;
			}

			//Privilege Function
			this.privilegedGetFullName = function(){
				return privateGetFullName();
			}

			//Public Function
			Employee.prototype.publicGetFullName = function(){
				return this.privilegedGetFullName()
			};
		}

		var emp = new Employee("Indrabhan", "Bhamare");
		document.write(emp.privilegedGetFullName() + "<br/>");		// At the time of calling privilege function we dont use this 											   keyword.
		document.write(emp.publicGetFullName());			// At the time of calling public function we dont use 											   prototype name, only use function name.
		
		document.write(emp.privateFullName + "<br/>")			// o/p undefined

		emp.privateFullName = "Bittu";					// on the fly we are creating and assigning value to a variable 										   and this variable is treated as public, Here no need to get 											   confuse just the names are same as that the name of private 											   variable.

		document.write(emp.privateFullName + "<br/>")			// Public variable created on fly.
		</script>
	</body>
	</head>
