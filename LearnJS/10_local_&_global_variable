Local Variable:- variable declared within the fucntion is known as local variable.
		 scope is within the function.
		 local variable ends as the function is closed 

Global Vraiable:- variable declared outside the fucntion is known as global variable.
		  scope is in whole script.
		  global variable ends as the web page is closed.

	***If you assign a value to a variable that has been not declared,It will automactically become a global variable,	
	even if it is present inside a function.

		Example:-
			function sample(){
				greeting = "Hello World"	// here we have not declare the variable, directly assing the value to it so 									   it become global variable
				document.write(greeting)
			}
	
			sample()				// o/p:- Hello World
			document.write(greeting)		// o/p:- Hello World Note:- we have access the variable outside the function.

	
	Example:-
		var greeting = "Hello Global";
		function helloWorld(){
			  var greeting = 'Hello Local';
			  greeting += '???';
			  alert(greeting)		// o/p:- Hello Local??? (Local variable gets modified within the local scope)
			}
		helloWorld();
		greeting += '!!!';
		alert(greeting)				// o/p:- Hello Global!!! (Gloval variable


********************** Variable Hositing ******************
Just like function hoisting, variable hoisting means variables will go at top position if its global and if its local than it will be at the top within the function.
Note:- If the variable is local than only the declaration is moved not the value assign to variable


	Example:-
		var greeting = "Hello Global";
		helloWorld();				// Function hoisting will move the function helloWorld() at the top;
		function helloWorld(){
		  alert(greeting)			// o/p:- undefined
		  var greeting = 'Hello Local';   	// Variable hoisting will only move the variable declaration at the top and not the 
							   value assign to it.
		}
		greeting += '!!!';
		alert(greeting)				// o/p:- Hello Global!!!


		Above function will become like this at runtime

		
		var greeting = "Hello Global";
		function helloWorld(){
		 *** var greeting;			// Variable hoisting moving only the variable declaration.
		  alert(greeting)			
		 *** var greeting = 'Hello Local';   	
		}
		helloWorld();
		greeting += '!!!';
		alert(greeting)


*********************Braces do not create scope in js ******************

otherNo is the global variable though it is define inside the braces
var no=100;
if (no > 100)
{
	var otherNo = no;
}
document.write(otherNo)		// Note in python also we can access the value outside the braces.
