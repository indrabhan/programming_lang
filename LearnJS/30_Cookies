Why Cookie are needed?
web application works on HTTP protocol which is stateless procotol.
This means after the web server has made the client request for the web page,the web
server will not remember any thing about the client that made the request.
Their are several ways to remember,the common and easiest way is by using cookies.


What are cookie?
Cookies are small text file that the browser store in visitors computer.
A cookies are basically a string of name-value pair separated by semi-colon.


How does cookie look
"color=red;expires=Fri, 5 June 2019 01:00:00 UTC;"

The variable expries specifies when the cookies is going to expire.
By default cookies are deleted when the current browser session ends.
If you want to store cookie on client computer even after the browser session
has ended than specify either "expire" or "max-age" attributes.

expires:- supported by IE
max-age:- supported by other modern browser.
Note:- So use both expires and max-age;(for cross browser solution.)

Domain Attribute:-Specifies the domain for which the cookies is valid.
	If you specify the domain as PragimTech.Blog.com that cookie will
	be valid for that sub-domain.It will not be valid for PragimTech.com.

	If you want cookie to be valid for all sub-domain of PragimTech.com
	then specify domain=PragimTech.com, So this cookie will be valid for:-
		PragimTech.com
		PragimTech.Blog.com
		PragimTech.Blog.KudVenkat.com


Path Attribute:-By default cookies are valid only for the web pages in the directory of the curret web page that stored them.
Example:-
	If a cookie is set by:- https://localhost/Home/Page2.html
	it will be vaikd for:-  https://localhost/Home/SubFolder/Page1.html
	but not for:-		https://localhost/page3.html

If you want to create a cookie that is valid for accross all your web pages in you website,
then set the path to the root of your web directory, that is, "/".
	document.cookie = "path=/"


secure Attribute:- Specifies that cookie is secure and is only used over HTTPS protocol
	which ensures that the cookie is always encrypted when transmitting from client to server.
	



How to write cookie
document.cookie = "color=red;expires=Fri, 5 June 2019 01:00:00 UTC;"


How to read cookie
var cookieString = document.cookie;

Example1:-
	<head>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	window.onload = function(){
		if (document.cookie){
			var previousColor = document.cookie.split("=")
			document.bgColor=previousColor[1]
			document.getElementById("selectColor").value = previousColor[1]
		}
		
	}
	function setColorBackground() {
		var exdays = 30;
		var d = new Date();
		d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays*24*60*60*1000));
		var expries = "expries=" + d.toGMTString()
		var selectedColor = document.getElementById("selectColor").value
		if (selectedColor != "white")
		{
			document.bgColor = selectedColor;
			document.cookie = "color=" + selectedColor + ";" + expries
		}
	}
	</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	<select id="selectColor" onchange="setColorBackground()">
		<option value="white">Select Color</option>
		<option value="red">Red</option>
		<option value="green">Green</option>
		<option value="blue">Blue</option>
	</select>
	</body>


Example2:-
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<script>

	function setCookie(cvalue, exdays){
		var d = new Date();
		d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays*24*60*60*1000));
		var expries = "expries" + d.toGMTString()
		document.cookie = "username=" + cvalue + ";" + expries
		alert("document.cookie:- "+ document.cookie)
	}

	function getCookie(){
		var cookieData = document.cookie.split("=")
		if (cookieData.length){
			return cookieData[1];
		}
		else{
			return false;
		}
	}

	function checkCookie() {
	  var user = getCookie();
	  var user;
	  if (user != "") {
	    	alert("Welcome again " + user);
	  		}
	  	else {
	     	user = prompt("Please enter your name:","");
	     	if (user != "" && user != null) {
	     	setCookie(user, 30)
	     	}
	  	}
	}

	</script>
	</head>
	<body onload="checkCookie()"></body>

	</html>
