			<h2>Dhule City</h2>
		</header>
			<p>
				The city, with industrial areas, schools, hospitals, supermarkets and residential areas, has communications and transport infrastructures. Dhule is largely emerging as one of the upcoming hubs of textile, edible oil, and power-loom across the state and has gained a strategic advantage for being on the junction of three National Highways viz. NH-3, NH-6, and NH-211 and on most anticipated Manmad - Indore Rail Project. Recently Ministry of Surface Transport has granted conversion of surrounding 4 state highways to National Highway, after which Dhule would be the one amongst very few cities in India being located on convergence of 7 National Highways. Conversion of NH-3 from four lanes to six lanes between Dhule and Nashik with modern facilities is under process.
