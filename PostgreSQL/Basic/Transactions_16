PostgreSQL Transactions:-

	BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK

	What is a database transaction:-
		A classical example of a transaction is a transfer from one bank account to another. A complete transaction must ensure 		subtracting an amount from the sender’s account and adding that same amount to the receiver’s account.

	ACID property:-
	
		Atomicity. In a transaction involving two or more discrete pieces of information, either all of the pieces are committed or 				   none are.
		Consistency. A transaction either creates a new and valid state of data, or, if any failure occurs, returns all data to its 				     state before the transaction was started.
		Isolation. A transaction in process and not yet committed must remain isolated from any other transaction.
		Durability. Committed data is saved by the system such that, even in the event of a failure and system restart, the data is 				    available in its correct state.


		Example:- create table
			  CREATE TABLE accounts (
			    id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
			    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
			    balance DEC(15,2) NOT NULL,
			    PRIMARY KEY(id)
			);

		Beginning a transaction:-
			--Query:-
				Begin;
				INSERT INTO accounts(name,balance)
				VALUES('Bob',10000);

				From the current session, you can see the change by querying the accounts table:
				--Query:- select * from accounts;

				However, if you start a new session and execute the query above, you will not see the change.


		Committing a transaction:-	
			To make the change become visible to other sessions (or users) you need to commit the transaction by using the 				following statement:
				--Query:-
					commit;


		Rolling back a transaction:-
			To roll back or undo the change of the current transaction, you use any of the following statement:
			--query:-
				rollback

			Note:- rollback will roll the data back untill the transaction is not commit.

Create table with data and without data:
	--Query:
		CREATE TABLE new_table
		AS existing _table;

		Above query will create with data


	--Query:-
		CREATE TABLE new_table
		AS existing _table
		WITH NO DATA;

		Above query will  create only table structure with no data.
