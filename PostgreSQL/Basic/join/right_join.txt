PostgreSQL Right join:- The right join is a reversed version of the left join. It produces a result set that contains all rows from the right table with matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, the left side will contain null values.

Setting up sample tables:-
Suppose we have two tables called basket_a and basket_b that stores fruits:

basket_a					basket_b

1, 'Apple'					1, 'Orange'
2, 'Orange'					2. 'Apple'
3, 'Banana'					3, 'Watermelon'
4, 'Cucumber'					4, 'Pear'

The tables have some common fruits such as apple and orange. 

The following statement performs the right join between the left and the right tables:

	SELECT
	    a.id id_a,
	    a.fruit fruit_a,
	    b.id id_b,
	    b.fruit fruit_b
	FROM
	    basket_a a
	RIGHT JOIN basket_b b ON a.fruit = b.fruit;

	O/P:-
		id_a	fruit_a	   id_b	    fruit_b
		1	Apple	    2	    Apple
		2	Orange	    1	    Orange
		null	null	    3       Watermelon
		null	null        4       Pear
