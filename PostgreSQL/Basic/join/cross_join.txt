PostgreSQL CROSS JOIN clause:-
	A CROSS JOIN clause allows you to produce the Cartesian Product of rows in two or more tables. Different from the other JOIN operators 		such as LEFT JOIN  or INNER JOIN, the CROSS JOIN does not have any matching condition in the join clause.

Note:- In Odoo product variant created when using Attribute and Attribute value is product cartesian.

Suppose we have to perform the CROSS JOIN of two tables T1 and T2. For every row from T1 and T2 i.e., a cartesian product, the result set will contain a row that consists of all columns in the T1 table followed by all columns in the T2 table. If T1 has N rows, T2 has M rows, the result set will have N x M rows.

The following illustrates the syntax of the PostgreSQL CROSS JOIN clause:-
	SELECT * 
	FROM T1
	CROSS JOIN T2;

The following statement is also equivalent to the CROSS JOIN above:-
	SELECT * 
	FROM T1, T2;

PostgreSQL CROSS JOIN example
The following CREATE TABLE statements create T1 and T2 tables and insert some sample data for the cross demonstration.

	CREATE TABLE T1 (label CHAR(1) PRIMARY KEY);

	CREATE TABLE T2 (score INT PRIMARY KEY);

	INSERT INTO T1 (label)
	VALUES
		('A'),
		('B');

	INSERT INTO T2 (score)
	VALUES
		(1),
		(2),
		(3)


The following statement uses the CROSS JOIN operator to join the T1 table with the T2 table.

	SELECT
		*
	FROM
		T1
	CROSS JOIN T2;

	O/P
		 label | score
		-------+-------
		 A     |     1
		 B     |     1
		 A     |     2
		 B     |     2
		 A     |     3
		 B     |     3
		(6 rows)
