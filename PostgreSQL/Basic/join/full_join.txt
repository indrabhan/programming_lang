PostgreSQL full outer join:- The full outer join or full join produces a result set that contains all rows from both the left and right 				tables, with the matching rows from both sides where available. 
			     If there is no match, the missing side contains null values.


The following statement illustrates the full outer join:

	SELECT
	    a.id id_a,
	    a.fruit fruit_a,
	    b.id id_b,
	    b.fruit fruit_b
	FROM
	    basket_a a
	FULL OUTER JOIN basket_b b ON a.fruit = b.fruit;

	Note that the OUTER keyword is optional.

	O/P:
		id_a	fruit_a	   id_b	    fruit_b
		1	Apple	    2	    Apple
		2	Orange	    1	    Orange
		3	Banana	    null    null
		4	Cucumber    null    null
		null	null	    3       Watermelon
		null    null        4       Pear
