Views:
	way of representing data of one or more tables in the database.
	When you create a view, you basically create a query and assign it a name.
	A view can be accessed as a virtual table in PostgreSQL.
	It represents data through SELECT Statement.


	Notice:-  view does not store data physically except for a materialized view.
	
		  1.)Means when you create a view, it creates a table for temp use, you can even use that view table in other querys.
		  	when you close the connection and come again then you can not directly access data from that view table.
			you have to again execute that view query in order to access data.

		  2.)If you want view table to store data physically/permanent then you have to use materialized view.

	
A view can be very useful in some cases such as:

	1.)A view helps simplify the complexity of a query because you can query a view, which is based on a complex query, using a simple 			SELECT statement.

	2.)Like a table, you can grant permission to users through a view that contains specific data that the users are authorized to see.

	3.)A view provides a consistent layer even the columns of underlying table changes.


Syntax:-
	CREATE VIEW view_name AS query;
	
	First, you specify the name of the view after the CREATE VIEW clause, then you put a query after the AS keyword. A query can be a 		simple SELECT statement or a complex SELECT statement with joins.



Create:-	Create the query to view full details of customer from below tables

		select * from customer order by customer_id
		select * from address
		select * from city
		select * from country

	
		2.)Below query is creating the view.

			create view customer_data as select cust.first_name, cust.last_name, ad.address , ci.city, co.country from customer 				cust
			inner join address ad on cust.address_id = ad.address_id 
			inner join city ci on ad.city_id = ci.city_id
			inner join country co on co.country_id = ci.country_id
			limit 5

		3.)Accessing the query like a table

			select * from customer_data

		Note:- If you try to execute the create view query 2nd time it will give error saying 
			ERROR: relation "customer_data" already exists.

			Suppose now you want to make the limit to 10 of create view query then you have to use of
			CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name 
			AS 
			query
