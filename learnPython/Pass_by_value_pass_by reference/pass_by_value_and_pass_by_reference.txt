1.)Pass by value: 
		Copy of the actual object is passed. 
		Changing the value of the copy of the object will not change the value of the original object.


2.)Pass by reference: 
		Reference to the actual object is passed. Changing the value of the new object will change the value of the original 			object.

		1.)Pass means to provide an argument to a function.

		2.)By reference means that the argument youâ€™re passing to the function is a reference to a variable that already exists in 			memory rather than an independent copy of that variable.

		Example:-
			In Python, arguments are passed by reference, i.e., reference to the actual object is passed.

			def appendNumber(arr):
			    arr.append(4)

			arr = [1, 2, 3]

			print(arr)  #Output: => [1, 2, 3]
			appendNumber(arr)
			print(arr)  #Output: => [1, 2, 3, 4]
