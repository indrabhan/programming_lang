API:- Application Programming Interface.

APIs allow applications to communicate with one another.  An API is not a database. It is an access point to an app that can access a database.

Example:- If I want to book a flight ticket.I will go one website and can check the available seat in different AirLines.
	  How this is possible that through one website i can check the availability of seat in different AirLines.
	  This is possible through API.
	  That one website is communicate with all AirLine through API.



	  When I recharge the jio no, I do not go to jio website and recharge my no
	  rather i go to third party i.e Paytm and do recharge my no.
	  so here Paytym does communicate with jio and does recharge for me.
	  means Paytm communicate with jio through API.


	  In my website you have to sign up first to login.
	  Google has the sign-in form and it uses all the authenticate rules to authenticate the user (means it has written that code)
          so if i do not want to write the authenticate code and still want the user to login throught all the autnentication process,
	  so i make the use of the code written by google through API. 

	  API Keys:- If i make the use of third party api, so it sometime provide me with api key(unique)
		     using that third party api key it can track my activity that i am not miss-using that api.
