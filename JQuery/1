How to use jQuery in a web application
Download the jQuery file from jQuery.com and reference it in your application just like any other JavaScript file.


Example : Adding a click event handler for a button control using raw JavaScript. addEventListener() method is not supported in IE < 9.

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.onload = function ()
    {
        // For all modern browsers
        if (document.addEventListener)
        {
            document.getElementById('button1')
                    .addEventListener('click', clickHandler, false);
        }
        else
        // For Internet Explorer < 9
        {
            document.getElementById('button1')
                    .attachEvent('onclick', clickHandler);
        }

        function clickHandler()
        {
            alert('jQuery Tutorial');
        }
    };
</script>
<input type="button" value="Click Me" id="button1" />

Example : Adding a click event handler for a button control using jQuery. With jQuery we have less code to achieve the same thing.We don't have to worry about cross-browser issues, as all this is taken care by jQuery.

Please Note : If you want this example to work in IE 6/7/8, then use jQuery 1.x. If there is no need to support IE 6/7/8, then use jQuery 2.x.

//please add the JQuery file here as refering js file for below prog which you have downloaded
<script type="text/javascript">
    $('document').ready(function () {
        $('#button1').click(function () {
            alert('jQuery Tutorial');
        });
    });
</script>
<input type="button" value="Click Me" id="button1" />

Points to remember :
1. ready() function ensures that the DOM is fully loaded.
2. $ is a shortcut for jQuery.
3. All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:
$( document ).ready( handler )
$().ready( handler ) (this is not recommended)
$( handler )


<script type="text/javascript">
    $(function () {
        $('#button1').click(function () {
            alert('jQuery Tutorial');
        });
    });
</script>
<input type="button" value="Click Me" id="button1" />
