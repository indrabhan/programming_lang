optimize jquery progress bar.


jQuery animate method documentation

At the moment the progress bar always counts from 1. For example
1. When you select 30%, it starts to count from 1 to 30 which is good.
2. Now if you select 70%, it starts again from 1 and counts all the way till 70, instead of continuing to count from 30 to 70.


$(document).ready(function () {
    $('#myButton').click(function () {
        animateProgressBar($('#ddlPercent').val());
    });

    function animateProgressBar(currentPercentage) {
        $("#innerDiv").animate({ "width": (currentPercentage * 500) / 100 }, {
            duration: 3000,
            step: function (now, fx) {
                $("#innerDiv").text(Math.ceil((now / 500) * 100) + ' %');
            }
        });
    }
});
