Some of the useful options to customize the draggable widget

Constrains dragging to within the bounds of the parent element
	HTML
		<div id="containerDiv" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; border: 3px solid black">
		    <div id="draggableDiv" class="divClass">
			Drag me around
		    </div>
		</div>

	jQuery
		$('#draggableDiv').draggable({
		    containment : 'parent'
		});

Changes the cursor style to "move" during the drag operation
	$('#draggableDiv').draggable({
	    cursor: 'move'
	});

Changes the opacity to 0.3 during the drag operation
	$('#draggableDiv').draggable({
	    opacity : 0.3
	});

Reverts the div element to its start position when dragging stops. Revert animation completes in 1000 milli-seconds.
	$('#draggableDiv').draggable({
	    revert: true,
	    revertDuration : 1000
	});
