Technical:-

<input type="number">

<a href=/route_name/>Add new car</a> 
	when you will click on Add new car the cursor will go to the route in controller.

return request.redirect('/route_name')


<form action='/route_name' method="POST">

the form fields name should be technical name of module fields, so you can get the dict {'technical_field_name: Value given by user on form}
so you can call the create method and pass the dict.
model.create(kw) 	kw is the dict specified in route.

<button type='submit>SAVE</button>

when you will click on save button the cursor will go to action and action is calling the route, so it will go to route.


Update:
	In table head
		<th>
			<a t-attf-href='/route_name?id=#(car.id)' 		#in car we are getting car object
		</th>
	
	Difference between t-attf and t-att

		t-attf : you can use object, here we have use the car object.
		t-att : you can not use the object.


	To send parameter we use "?" and parameter name and assign value to parameter using "=".


	@http.route('/route_name', auth='public', type='http')
	def abc(self, **kw):
		print ('car id=', kw.get('id'))


Image icons:
	go to fontawesome website
		<a href="route_name"<i class="fa fa-pencil"/> </a>

				portal.py (file)
					class CustomerPortal


	from odoo.addons.portal.controllers.portal import CustomerPortal

	class MyClass(CustomerPortal):
	
		@route  (if you want to write only @route then "from odoo.http import route")
		
			request.env  (if you want to write only @route then "from odoo.http import request")


In template(xml file)

	you can write below code directly

	<t t-set='partners' t-value="request.env['res.partner'].search([])">


	Fields:

		1.)Many2one:

				if kw[file]:
					file = kw.get('file').stream.read()		// read the file.


				in dictionary:
					'file': base64.encodestring(file),



dynamic image src:
	
	<img class='' alt='car1' t-attf-src="data:image/*; base64,{(car.file)}"


	t-attf-href="/car/full_description?id=#(car.id)"
