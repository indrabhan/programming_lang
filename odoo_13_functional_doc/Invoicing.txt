		1.)Create invoice and register the payment.It has done the reconcialiation process for you and the invoice is paid as you can 				see the amount due as zero.
		2.)Or you can create the payment and in that invocie you see the "Add" button near the amount due.when you click on it you 				reconcile that payment with that invoice.
		3.)Now in Odoo you have shown that you have receive money via Bank.
		4.)In Bank Journal card(Kanban) of Accounting Overview you will see the paid amount in difference.
		5.)It means that your actual bank account has received that amount.So in odoo you have to show that you have received that 			   money in account so you have to import the bank statement or create it and reconcile/validate it.
		Note:- In bank statement make the ending balance equal to the computed balance.

	2.)We can reconcile open invoices with bank statements:
		1.)Suppose invoice is in posted state and you receive the money in you bank account, so you need to link the bank entery with 				this invoice. 
		2.)Create the bank statement or import and reconcile/validate it with the invoice. 
		3.)That invoice will be mark as paid.
